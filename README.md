Sistema de Clasificación de Activación Muscular para Electrodos en Ubicaciones Desconocidas

This work presents the implementation of a muscle activation classification system based on a dataset obtained through a class-channel relationship. Each class corresponds to a specific muscular action, while the channels represent electrodes placed along an upper limb, covering the entire brachial region, the phalanges, metacarpus, carpus, antebrachial region, and the back of the hand. The system considers the stimulation relationship of each channel depending on a movement categorized into a class, establishing a bidirectionality between the degree of activation for a specific action and its most prominent channel. The classifier employs two joint neural networks, each with one hidden layer and several incorporated neurons, fed with extracted feature vectors such as Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Waveform Length (WAV), and Root Mean Square (RMS) using the 'EMG Feature Extraction Toolbox' for MATLAB.
